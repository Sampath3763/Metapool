# Render.com deployment manifest for the Virtual Queue project
# This file defines two services: a Node web service for the backend and a static site for the frontend.
# Replace placeholder values or set environment variables in the Render dashboard as appropriate.

services:
  - type: web
    name: virtual-queue-backend
    env: node
    plan: free
    region: oregon
    branch: main
    # root directory containing package.json for the backend
    root: backend
    buildCommand: npm install
    startCommand: npm start
    envVars:
      # Do NOT commit secrets into the repository. You can leave values blank here and set them in the
      # Render dashboard, or replace the values with secure parameters.
      - key: MONGO_URI
        value: ""
      - key: ADMIN_PASSWORD
        value: ""
      - key: JWT_SECRET
        value: ""

  - type: static
    name: virtual-queue-frontend
    env: static
    plan: free
    branch: main
    root: frontend
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    publishPath: dist

# Notes:
# - The `root` fields point Render at the subfolders containing each service's package.json.
# - For security, set the environment variable values in the Render dashboard (Service -> Environment).
# - If you prefer the frontend served by a CDN-enabled static site, use this static service. If you
#   want the frontend as a Node server, change the type to `web` and adjust startCommand accordingly.
